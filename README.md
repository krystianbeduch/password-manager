# Password manager
The project was developed as part of my IT studies during a multi-platform application design class.

Password manager is a desktop application for securely managing a user's password collection, written in C++ using the Qt library. 
The project offers an intuitive graphical interface and a number of features, such as encrypting data, organizing passwords into groups, generating random passwords, 
and importing and exporting data in various formats.
All passwords are encrypted and stored in a local PostgreSQL database to ensure data confidentiality. 
Additionally, the application requires user authentication before access is granted, providing an extra layer of security.
The entire project is modular in structure and built using the CMake build system.

## Functional description
### User authentication
When launching the application, a login dialog appears prompting the user to enter an access password. If the user does not remember the password or is using the application for the first time, they can check the `Create new profile` checkbox. Creating a new profile is equivalent to erasing all existing data. This means that if the user has forgotten their previous password, there is no way to recover the old data, and they must accept its loss.

After creating a new profile, all existing tables in the database are cleared and reinitialized with default values. These include:
- 4 default groups: Work, Personal, Banking, Email
- 3 example entries to demonstrate how the application works

The entered access password is used to generate an encryption key, which is essential for securely storing and retrieving sensitive user data. 
Additionally, to prevent unauthorized access, the login dialog will automatically reappear after 5 minutes of inactivity. 
This ensures that if the application is left unattended, access to the data remains protected.

### Password management
The main window of the application displays a table containing the user's saved password entries. Each row in the table includes the following columns:
- ID - identificator of the entry
- Service name – the name of the website or service
- Username – the associated login
- Password – shown as bullet dots for security __•__
- Addition date – when the entry was created
- Actions – quick access to: `Show`, `Edit`, or `Delete` the entry

🔍 Actions on a single entry:
- Show – reveals the actual password in plain text
- Edit – opens an edit form where the user can modify the service name, username, password, or assigned group
- Delete – deletes the entry after a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental loss

➕ Adding New Passwords
Users can add new password entries using multiple methods:
- `Ctrl + N` keyboard shortcut
- clicking the plus icon in the top toolbar
- Menu: `Management` -> `Add Password` 
This action opens a form where the user inputs password data.

📝 Editing Existing Passwords
Passwords can be edited using:
- `Ctrl + E` keyboard shortcut
- clicking the EditPaste icon in the top toolbar
- Menu: `Management -> Edit Password`  
When triggered, the user is first asked to select the entry to be edited. After selecting it, the same input form as for adding a new password is shown.

🗑️ Deleting Passwords
To delete a password:
- `Ctrl + Del` keyboard shortcut
- click the trash icon in the toolbar
- Menu: `Management` -> `Delete Password`
Each deletion requires confirmation to avoid data loss.

Additionally, users can remove all password entries at once by selecting:
`Management` -> `Delete All Passwords`
This action is also protected by confirmation dialogs to prevent unintentional mass deletion.

### Group management
- Assign passwords to user-defined groups
 
### Generate passwords
Generate strong random passwords

### Password encryption
- Store all passwords in encrypted form in a local PostgreSQL database- 
  
### Reorder password
- Reorder password entries based on user preferences
  
### Import and export password data
- Import and export password data to/from CSV, JSON, and XML files



Presents all tasks in a scrollable list using a _RecyclerView_. Each task is visually styled according to the `item_task.xml` layout, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly appearance. 
Each task item displays the following information:
- Title — the main name or description of the task
- Deadline — the due date and time by which the task should be completed
- Creation date — the date and time when the task was originally added
- Priority — indicates the importance level of the task, which can be _High_, _Medium_, or _Low_
- Completion status — represented by a ✔ symbol when the task is marked as completed
- Attachment icon — displayed if one or more attachments are associated with the task, indicating additional files or resources linked to it
