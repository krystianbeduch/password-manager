# Password manager
The project was developed as part of my IT studies during a multi-platform application design class.

Password manager is a desktop application for securely managing a user's password collection, written in C++ using the Qt library. 
The project offers an intuitive graphical interface and a number of features, such as encrypting data, organizing passwords into groups, generating random passwords, 
and importing and exporting data in various formats.
All passwords are encrypted and stored in a local PostgreSQL database to ensure data confidentiality. 
Additionally, the application requires user authentication before access is granted, providing an extra layer of security.
The entire project is modular in structure and built using the CMake build system.

## Functional description
### User authentication 
üîê
When launching the application, a login dialog appears prompting the user to enter an access password. If the user does not remember the password or is using the application for the first time, they can check the `Create new profile` checkbox. Creating a new profile is equivalent to erasing all existing data. This means that if the user has forgotten their previous password, there is no way to recover the old data, and they must accept its loss.

After creating a new profile, all existing tables in the database are cleared and reinitialized with default values. These include:
- 4 default groups: Work, Personal, Banking, Email
- 3 example entries to demonstrate how the application works

The entered access password is used to generate an encryption key, which is essential for securely storing and retrieving sensitive user data. 
Additionally, to prevent unauthorized access, the login dialog will automatically reappear after 5 minutes of inactivity. 
This ensures that if the application is left unattended, access to the data remains protected.
